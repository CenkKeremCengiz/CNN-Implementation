# CNN-Implementation

This project is developed as the third (and the last) homework of CENG403 (Introduction to Deep Learning). The project is divided into 3 parts:
- Part1: Convolution and pooling operations (also their backprops) are implemented without using vector or tensor operations
- Part2: A custom CNN is implemented using PyTorch
- Part3: Trained ResNet18 (for CIFAR10 dataset) using transfer learning
